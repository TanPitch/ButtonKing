This Arduino library is improving the usage of a singe button for input.
It shows how to use an digital input pin with a single pushbutton attached
for detecting some of the typical button press events like single clicks, double clicks and long-time pressing.
This enables you to reuse the same button for multiple functions and lowers the hardware invests.
